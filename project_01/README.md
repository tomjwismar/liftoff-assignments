# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview

	My project is called "The Car Collective". The idea for this came from 
my love of all things cars. My app will enable users to enter vehicle 
info such as make/model, vehicle stats such as 0-60 times, mpg, horsepower, 
style(4door, 2door ect), add links to other useful websites(autotrade,edmunds ect). Users will be able to do side by side comparisons 
of vehicles in the database, or just view a particular vehicles info. Users 
will be able to review vehicles in the database. Ideally the users will use 
this tool to be better informed when they are about to make a new purchase.

## Features
1. User Login: User wil be able to create accounts, and log into the application.Each 
   User will have a profile page listing vehicles they have reviewed.
2. Search: Users will be able to search vehicles that have been entered into the database
3: Adding Cars: Users will be able to add vehicles to the database
4: Reviews: Users will be able to give reviews on the car pages.


## Technologies
Java
Spring boot
thymeleaf
javascript


potentially: groovy grails and gorm

## What I'll Have to Learn
	One problem i would like to solve would be to use webscraping to populate vehicle
information rather than a user entering in that information. At present a member
of "The Car Collective" will only be able to see vehicles previous users have 
entered into the datatbase.
