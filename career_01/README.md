2. Brief description of pre-limenary research: 

As an aspiring java developer, a meet up with the
St. Louis Java Users Group seemed to be the most appropriate.

3. Questions for Meetup:
How might i use GORM in my java programming career?

4. Next steps for continuing to learn about the topic:
I learned that GORM is an open source ORM tool that is part of the Grails
web framework. On a high level it seemed intuitive and easy to learn.
OCI, which is the company that is responsible for Grails and GORM offer training
classes led by the cofounder of GORM, Jeff Brown.
